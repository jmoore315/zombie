			p Itâ€™s how most people find out about where to live off-campus. But as college students who have grown up in the information age, hearsay is no longer sufficient. uHoused was started by students at Northwestern to help you find the best off-campus living situation, at the best price. We make it relevant by collaborating only with local realtors and students at your school, and we make it easy by allowing you to intuitively browse apartment listings, subletting opportunities, and used furniture.
			p uHoused? You should be.
